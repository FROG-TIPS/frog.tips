Abstract

   To facilitate exchange of FROG tips, we've created this big dumb
   protocol. Duh.

1. FROG Considerations

   FROG is not an initialism. Do not represent FROG as F.R.O.G. in official
   documents. R.I.B.B.I.T. MAY be represented either as R.I.B.B.I.T. or
   RIBBIT as the former is very difficult to type.

2. THE R.I.B.B.I.T. PROTOCOL

   The R.I.B.B.I.T. protocol (Remote Interaction Bounding Behavior
   Including Tips) defines the high-level semantics for exchanging FROG
   tips.

   We define the protocol in this format that I honestly had never heard
   about before my crypto freak friend told me about it. Anyway here's
   Wonderwall:

   RibbitProtocol DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN

      FrogTip ::= SEQUENCE {
         number    INTEGER,
         tip       UTF8String
      }

      Croak ::= SEQUENCE(SIZE(0..50)) OF FrogTip
   END

   Each FROG tip contains semantic content and the number of the tip for
   handy reference. "number" MUST BE unique across all FROG tips
   everywhere until the end of time.

RFC 42069               THE R.I.B.B.I.T. PROTOCOL             February 2016

   One gently queries for FROG tips and receives a sequence of zero to
   fifty FROG tips back. This sequence is a Croak of FROG tips. This
   summarizes the R.I.B.B.I.T. protocol.

3. An Example Exchange

   An example R.I.B.B.I.T. exchange to query a Croak over HTTP is as
   follows.

   First, a Croak represented as a DER-encoded bytestream is requested.

     GET /tips HTTP/1.0
     Accept: application/der-stream

   FROG is sometimes sneaky and may return base64-encoded data. In this
   example the data is raw, baby:

     HTTP/1.0 200 OK
     Content-Type: application/der-stream
     0\x190\x17\x02\x01\x01\x0c\x12DO NOT ENCODE FROG

   This data can then be decoded using an ASN.1 DER decoder library.

   DO NOT CONCLUDE FROG. FROG DOES NOT HANDLE BREAKUPS WELL.
